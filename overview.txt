Potential ideas.

Transit system comprised of bus and subway lines, where you can route person to potential places, where bus or subway lines are linear and may change dependant on the time and day and weekday. Overlapping systems can be optimized dependant on either cost or distance or time. Payment system on card or based on money to track how much is required.
